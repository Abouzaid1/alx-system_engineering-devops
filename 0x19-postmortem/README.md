Postmortem: Airbnb Clone - Search Nightmare (Incident #2024-06-10)
Issue Summary:

Duration: June 10th, 2024, 10:00 AM PST - 1:00 PM PST (3 hours) (Ugh, way longer than I hoped!)
Impact: Users of "Wanderlust," my Airbnb clone app, were met with frustration! Listing searches ground to a halt, taking forever to load. This impacted a whopping 70% of users – basically everyone trying to find their dream vacation rental.
Root Cause: My code, specifically a new location filtering feature I just deployed two weeks ago (big mistake!), turned out to be the culprit.
Timeline:

10:00 AM PST: My phone starts buzzing with user complaints about the sluggish search. Panic sets in!
10:15 AM PST: I frantically check server logs and monitoring tools. Everything seems fine – no infrastructure issues or errors. Confusion reigns!
10:45 AM PST: After a cup of strong coffee (or three), I remember the location filtering code I added two weeks ago. Could that be it?
11:00 AM PST: Diving back into the code, I discover the culprit – complex geospatial calculations bogging down the search query. Ugh, why didn't I think of that during development?
11:30 AM PST - 1:00 PM PST: This is where things get messy. Disabling the location filtering temporarily fixes the issue, but that's not a long-term solution. The next hour and a half are spent furiously optimizing the code, streamlining those pesky calculations.
1:00 PM PST: Victory! The optimized location filtering is back in place, and search functionality is restored. Phew, that was a close call.
Root Cause and Resolution:

My shiny new location filtering feature, while functional, relied on overly complex calculations to pinpoint listings within a specific area.  This complexity overloaded the database, causing those agonizing delays.  The fix involved streamlining those calculations without sacrificing accuracy.  Basically, I had to make the search smarter, not harder.

Lessons Learned (the hard way):

Don't Be Cowboy: Two weeks of solo development can lead to blind spots. Peer code reviews are essential, even for personal projects.
Test, Test, Test: Performance testing should be a priority, not an afterthought. Unit tests specifically focused on query performance would have saved the day (and a lot of stress).
Baby Steps: Next time, I'll deploy new features incrementally, starting with a simpler version and monitoring performance closely before going all-in.
Next Steps:

Embrace the Review: I'm reaching out to developer communities for code review – gotta get those fresh eyes on my work.
Profile Like a Pro: Integrating performance profiling tools into the development process is a must. Better to catch bottlenecks early than scramble later.
Location, Location, Optimization: There's a whole world of geospatial search optimization techniques out there. Time to do some research!
This incident was a real wake-up call.  While the fix is in place, it reinforces the importance of careful development practices.   The good news? "Wanderlust" is back up and running, and users can find their dream vacation rentals with ease (hopefully without another developer meltdown!).
